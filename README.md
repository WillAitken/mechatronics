# mechatronics competition
End of semester mechatronics competition. This repository contains the Arduino code used in the competition and a video demonstrating the functionality of the robot.

The objective was for three robots be able to manouver about a square grid, each collecting objects and returning them to the starting zone. The competition was timed and required that the robots do not collide. They also meeded to read an IR beacon to determine their starting locations and collect objects from each edge of the grid.
